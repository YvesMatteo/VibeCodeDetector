The OWASP Top 10 is the industry-standard reference for the most critical web application security risks. Whether you're building a SaaS product, an e-commerce site, or an internal tool, these ten categories cover the vulnerabilities most likely to get you breached.

Here's a practical checklist you can use to audit your application against each one.

## A01: Broken Access Control

Access control failures are the number one web application security risk. They happen when users can act outside their intended permissions.

**What to check:**
- Can users access other users' data by changing an ID in the URL?
- Are API endpoints checking authentication AND authorization?
- Can users escalate their role or permissions?
- Are admin functions accessible to regular users?
- Do you enforce server-side access control (not just hiding UI elements)?

**How CheckVibe helps:** Our auth scanner tests for missing authentication on endpoints, IDOR patterns, and privilege escalation paths.

## A02: Cryptographic Failures

Previously called "Sensitive Data Exposure," this category covers failures in cryptography that lead to data exposure.

**What to check:**
- Is data transmitted over HTTPS with a valid certificate?
- Are TLS versions current (TLS 1.2+ only)?
- Are passwords hashed with strong algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, argon2)?
- Are API keys and secrets stored securely (not in source code)?
- Is HSTS enabled to prevent protocol downgrade?

**How CheckVibe helps:** The SSL/TLS scanner checks certificate validity, protocol versions, and cipher strength. The API key scanner detects exposed secrets.

## A03: Injection

Injection flaws — SQL injection, XSS, command injection — occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter without validation.

**What to check:**
- Are all database queries parameterized?
- Is user input sanitized before rendering in HTML?
- Are command-line calls using safe APIs (not string concatenation)?
- Is there a Content Security Policy blocking inline scripts?
- Are ORM/query builders used instead of raw SQL?

**How CheckVibe helps:** Dedicated SQL injection and XSS scanners test with hundreds of payload variations across all input vectors.

## A04: Insecure Design

This is about fundamental design flaws, not implementation bugs. No amount of code fixing can address a design that's insecure by nature.

**What to check:**
- Is there threat modeling for critical features?
- Are security requirements defined before development?
- Do business logic flows have abuse-case testing?
- Are rate limits in place for sensitive operations (login, password reset)?
- Is there defense in depth (multiple security layers)?

**How CheckVibe helps:** The DDoS/rate-limit scanner checks for rate limiting and WAF presence. The CSRF scanner verifies anti-forgery protections.

## A05: Security Misconfiguration

The most common issue we find in scans. Default configurations, unnecessary features, and missing hardening.

**What to check:**
- Are security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)?
- Is directory listing disabled?
- Are default credentials changed?
- Are error messages generic (not exposing stack traces)?
- Are unnecessary HTTP methods disabled?
- Are CORS policies restrictive?

**How CheckVibe helps:** The security headers scanner checks all major headers. The CORS scanner tests for overly permissive policies. The tech scanner identifies exposed version information.

## A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Using components with known vulnerabilities is one of the easiest attack vectors.

**What to check:**
- Are all npm/pip/gem dependencies up to date?
- Are there known CVEs in your dependency tree?
- Is the framework version current and supported?
- Are unused dependencies removed?
- Do you have automated dependency scanning in CI/CD?

**How CheckVibe helps:** The dependency scanner checks your package.json against known vulnerability databases and flags outdated packages.

## A07: Identification and Authentication Failures

Weaknesses in authentication mechanisms that allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens.

**What to check:**
- Is multi-factor authentication available?
- Are passwords enforced with minimum complexity?
- Are session tokens rotated after login?
- Is there brute force protection (account lockout, rate limiting)?
- Are session cookies marked Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite?

**How CheckVibe helps:** The auth scanner tests login flows, the cookie scanner checks session security flags, and the CSRF scanner verifies token implementation.

## A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures

Failures related to code and infrastructure that don't protect against integrity violations — like insecure CI/CD pipelines or auto-update mechanisms.

**What to check:**
- Are dependencies verified with lock files and checksums?
- Is the CI/CD pipeline secured against unauthorized changes?
- Are subresource integrity (SRI) hashes used for external scripts?
- Are code reviews required before merging?

**How CheckVibe helps:** The security headers scanner checks for SRI usage and the GitHub security scanner audits your repository configuration.

## A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Without logging and monitoring, breaches go undetected. Most breaches are discovered by external parties, not the victim.

**What to check:**
- Are login attempts logged (successes and failures)?
- Are access control failures logged?
- Is there alerting for suspicious patterns?
- Are logs stored securely and tamper-proof?
- Is there an incident response plan?

**How CheckVibe helps:** The audit logging scanner checks for monitoring infrastructure and logging practices.

## A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

SSRF occurs when a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL, allowing attackers to access internal services.

**What to check:**
- Do URL inputs validate against internal IP ranges?
- Are webhook URLs restricted to public addresses?
- Is DNS rebinding mitigated?
- Are cloud metadata endpoints blocked (169.254.169.254)?
- Is there an allowlist for external service URLs?

**How CheckVibe helps:** The redirect scanner tests for open redirect and SSRF patterns, and the security headers scanner verifies proper configuration.

## Run the Full Checklist Automatically

Going through this checklist manually for every deployment isn't realistic. That's why automated scanning exists — to run all these checks consistently, quickly, and repeatedly.
