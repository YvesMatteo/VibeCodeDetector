Every website deployed to the internet faces a constant barrage of automated attacks. Bots scan for open ports, probe for SQL injection, and test for misconfigured headers — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you're not scanning your own site first, attackers will do it for you.

## What Is Automated Security Scanning?

Automated security scanning is the process of using software tools to systematically check a website or web application for known vulnerabilities. Unlike manual penetration testing, automated scanners can run in minutes and cover dozens of attack vectors simultaneously.

A modern scanner checks for things like:

- **Injection flaws** — SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- **Configuration issues** — missing security headers, permissive CORS, weak SSL/TLS
- **Exposed secrets** — API keys, database credentials, tokens visible in source code or network requests
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** — known CVEs in JavaScript packages, frameworks, and libraries
- **Authentication weaknesses** — broken auth flows, session mismanagement, CSRF gaps

## Why Manual Testing Isn't Enough

Manual penetration testing is valuable but it has limitations. A human tester might spend days reviewing a single application. They bring expertise and creativity, but they can't run 30 different security checks in under a minute.

Automated scanning complements manual testing by providing:

1. **Speed** — scan an entire site in under 60 seconds
2. **Consistency** — every scan runs the same checks, every time
3. **Coverage** — test attack vectors that a manual tester might overlook
4. **Frequency** — scan after every deployment, not once a quarter

## The 30 Checks Every Website Needs

At CheckVibe, we built our scanner suite around the most common and most dangerous vulnerability categories. Here's what a comprehensive scan covers:

### Infrastructure & Configuration
- **Security Headers** — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **SSL/TLS** — certificate validity, protocol version, cipher strength
- **DNS** — DNSSEC, SPF, DKIM, DMARC configuration
- **CORS** — overly permissive cross-origin policies
- **Cookie Security** — Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite flags

### Application Security
- **SQL Injection** — error-based, time-based, and blind SQLi detection
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** — reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS
- **CSRF** — missing or weak cross-site request forgery protection
- **Open Redirects** — URL redirect vulnerabilities that enable phishing
- **File Upload** — unrestricted upload endpoints

### Secrets & Exposure
- **API Key Detection** — exposed keys for AWS, Stripe, Supabase, Firebase, and dozens more
- **GitHub Secrets** — leaked credentials in public repositories
- **Tech Stack Detection** — identifies frameworks, libraries, and versions

### Backend-Specific
- **Supabase** — RLS policies, exposed service keys, public table access
- **Firebase** — security rules, exposed config, unauthenticated access
- **Hosting Provider** — Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Railway-specific misconfigurations

### Advanced
- **DDoS Protection** — WAF presence, CDN configuration, rate limiting
- **Domain Hijacking** — DNS takeover risks, expired registrations
- **Vibe Coding Detection** — AI-generated code patterns that introduce vulnerabilities

## How to Start Scanning Your Site

Getting started with automated security scanning takes less than a minute:

1. **Enter your URL** — point the scanner at your production site
2. **Run the scan** — all 30 checks execute in parallel
3. **Review findings** — each issue comes with severity, description, and fix guidance
4. **Fix and rescan** — verify your fixes with another scan

The key is to make scanning a habit, not a one-time event. The best teams scan after every deployment and set up alerts for new critical findings.

## Building Security Into Your Workflow

Automated scanning is most effective when it's integrated into your development workflow:

- **Pre-deployment scans** — catch issues before they reach production
- **Scheduled scans** — run daily or weekly audits automatically
- **CI/CD integration** — add security checks to your GitHub Actions pipeline
- **Webhook alerts** — get notified in Slack or Discord when new vulnerabilities appear

Security isn't a feature you ship once. It's a practice you maintain continuously. Automated scanning makes that practice sustainable, even for solo developers and small teams.
