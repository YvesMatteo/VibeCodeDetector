## Vercel Web Analytics Integration

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made:

**1. Package Installation**
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using npm with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the resolved dependencies

**2. Modified Files**
- **src/app/layout.tsx**: Added Analytics component to the root layout
  - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after the `<Toaster />` component
  - Preserved all existing code structure, fonts, metadata, and components

### Implementation Details:

The project uses the Next.js App Router architecture with TypeScript. The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (`src/app/layout.tsx`) which wraps the entire application, ensuring analytics tracking is available on all pages.

The `<Analytics />` component was placed at the end of the `<body>` tag, following best practices for non-blocking script loading and maintaining the existing application structure.

### Verification:

✅ TypeScript compilation passed with no errors (`npm run type-check`)
✅ ESLint validation passed for the modified file (no new linting errors introduced)
✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions
✅ Lock files properly updated

### Notes:

- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation to resolve peer dependency conflicts with the project's existing Vite version
- The full build requires environment variables (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY) but TypeScript compilation succeeded, confirming our changes are syntactically correct
- Analytics will automatically start tracking page views and web vitals once deployed to Vercel
