Push all changes to GitHub. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` to see what's changed
2. Stage all modified and new files (but NOT .env files or anything with secrets)
3. Create a commit with a concise, descriptive message based on the actual changes
4. Push to the current branch on origin
5. Show the result (success or any errors)

If there are no changes to commit, say so and skip.
