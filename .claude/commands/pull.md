Pull the latest changes from GitHub. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
2. If there are uncommitted changes, warn me and ask whether to stash them first
3. Run `git pull origin` for the current branch
4. Show what changed (new commits, files updated)
5. If changes were stashed, ask whether to restore them
